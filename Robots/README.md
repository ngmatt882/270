# Robot Cars

Two cars that aims to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles.

Robbie has three sensors and 4 bumper sensors, and only makes decisions based on its current situation. 
When it meets an obstacle directly infront, Robbie will move backward and forward endlessly.

Rennie has one less sensor than Robbie but has a memory of the previous situation. 
This allows for Rennie to maneuver around obstacle directly in front.
